# Explanation

I'll help synthesize a new constitutional draft that incorporates the common values and principles from all the provided drafts while being inclusive of different viewpoints. Let me analyze the key areas of agreement and potential conflicts.
Here are some key decisions made in the synthesis:

1. **Preamble**: Kept relatively brief while acknowledging both historical origins and future vision. Avoided contentious claims about specific goals or methods.

2. **Tenets**: Organized into clear categories that appeared consistently across drafts. Focused on principles with broad agreement.

3. **Governance Structure**: Maintained the three-body structure (DReps, SPOs, CC) which had consensus across drafts.

4. **Technical Details**: Moved most specific parameters to the Guardrails appendix to allow for evolution.

5. **Areas of Agreement**:
- Fixed ADA supply
- Permissionless access
- Transparent governance
- Balanced power structure
- Treasury oversight

6. **Handled Divergent Views By**:
- Using inclusive language
- Focusing on principles over specifics
- Allowing flexibility in implementation
- Maintaining room for evolution

7. **Omitted Areas of Conflict**:
- Specific compensation models
- Detailed power distribution
- Rigid operational requirements
- Prescriptive technical standards

Would you like me to expand on any particular section or explain the reasoning behind specific synthesis choices?


# CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN ECOSYSTEM CONSTITUTION

## PREAMBLE

The Cardano blockchain represents a decentralized digital infrastructure empowering individuals and communities to manage their identity, value, and governance in an open and permissionless manner. Through the evolution from its founding by Input Output Hong Kong, Emurgo, and the Cardano Foundation to the present community-driven governance model, Cardano has demonstrated its commitment to decentralization, transparency, and continuous improvement.

This Constitution establishes a governance framework that balances the technical implementation of "code as law" with human judgment through the Constitutional Committee, while preserving the core values of decentralization, security, and sustainability. It serves as a living document to guide the ongoing development and governance of the Cardano ecosystem.

## ARTICLE I. CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN TENETS AND GUARDRAILS

These tenets shall guide all participants in the Cardano ecosystem and inform the evaluation of governance actions. The order of presentation does not imply priority among tenets.

### Section 2: Core Tenets

1. **Transaction Processing**
   - Transactions shall not be intentionally degraded or censored
   - Transactions shall be processed expediently for their intended purpose
   - The network shall maintain reasonable performance and reliability standards

2. **Economic Accessibility**
   - Transaction costs shall be predictable 
   - Fees shall be structured to balance accessibility with network security
   - The system shall prevent wasteful resource consumption

6. **Sustainability and Evolution** 
   - The ecosystem shall promote long-term sustainability
   - Governance shall balance innovation with stability
   - Resource usage shall be optimized through efficient design

7. **Interoperability**
