This GitHub repo https://github.com/Cerkoryn/draft-constitution/tree/cerkoryn-version/CommunityDrafts
Has many constitution drafts for a cardano constitution. Chatgpt attempted to consolidate them with the prompt "Synthesize all the community drafts with the working notes to distill the common values and principles into a new draft. For different opinions, try to expand the section to be inclusive of all viewpoints. If the viewpoints are in direct conflict, then omit that section.

Strive to use clear and concise language."

Please do your best with the same prompt with markdown output that I can download.

******************
Here's my attempt at synthesizing the common values and principles from the Cardano community drafts into a new draft, following the prompt you provided:

Cardano Constitution - Community Synthesized Draft
Preamble
We, the members of the Cardano community, commit to the following values and principles to guide our governance, interactions, and the development of our ecosystem.

Values and Principles
Decentralization
Commitment to Decentralization: We uphold the principle that power and decision-making should be distributed across the network to prevent centralization and promote resilience.

Openness
Transparency: All processes, decisions, and changes should be transparent to the community. 
Inclusivity: Encouragement of participation from all members of the community, regardless of their stake or background.

Security
Safety of the Network: Protecting the network from vulnerabilities is paramount. 
Privacy: Ensuring that individual privacy rights are respected within the bounds of legal and ethical considerations.

Innovation
Fostering Development: We encourage innovation through support for developers, experimentation, and the integration of new technologies that benefit the network.

Accountability
Responsibility: Those with governance roles must act responsibly, with the community's interest at heart.
Governance Feedback Loop: Mechanisms for feedback, review, and accountability are essential.

Sustainability
Long-Term Vision: Actions taken should consider the longevity and sustainability of the Cardano ecosystem.

Equality and Fairness
Non-Discrimination: No discrimination based on stake size, nationality, ethnicity, or any other basis.
Fair Distribution: Resources and opportunities within the ecosystem should be distributed fairly.

Community
Community Engagement: Active engagement with the community for decision-making processes.
Education: Commitment to educating users and stakeholders about Cardano's principles and technology.

Legal Compliance
Adherence to Law: While striving for autonomy, we recognize the necessity to comply with applicable laws and regulations.

Omitted Sections Due to Conflict:
Consensus Mechanisms: Due to varied and conflicting opinions on the best approach for consensus, this section has been omitted.
Economic Model: The specifics of monetary policy, staking rewards, and taxation within the Cardano ecosystem show significant divergence, hence, this is not included.

Conclusion
This draft aims to encapsulate the spirit of the Cardano community, promoting a balanced, inclusive, and forward-looking governance model. It serves as a living document, subject to change as our community evolves.

You can download this markdown by copying the text above into a text editor and saving it with a .md extension. Remember, this synthesis is based on the community drafts available at the time of this request, and it's by no means exhaustive or final. The beauty of Cardano's governance is in its continuous, community-driven evolution. Now, go forth and govern with wit and wisdom!
