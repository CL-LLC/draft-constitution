# CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN ECOSYSTEM CONSTITUTION

## PREAMBLE

*Note: This preamble provides context but is non-binding for the purpose of assessing the constitutionality of proposed governance actions.*

The Cardano blockchain emerged as a collaborative effort between Input Output Hong Kong, Emurgo, and the Cardano Foundation, who together with the broader community established a foundation for decentralized infrastructure. Through rigorous academic research, peer review, and community input, Cardano has evolved into a public, permissionless blockchain that empowers individuals and communities globally.

Recognizing the transition from federated governance to community stewardship, we establish this Constitution to guide the continued development and governance of the Cardano blockchain. While we may be geographically, politically, and culturally diverse, we are united in our commitment to leveraging blockchain technology to foster positive change.

This Constitution reflects our collective dedication to maintaining a secure, scalable, and decentralized ecosystem that serves humanity through technological innovation and collaborative governance.
