## Preamble

Recognizing that the three pioneering entities, Input-Output Hong Kong, Emurgo, and the Cardano Foundation, in collaboration with the Cardano Community, have fostered the emergence of the Cardano Blockchain, laying the foundation for a decentralized digital infrastructure that empowers individuals and promotes collaboration and innovation. Their efforts have shaped a vibrant and diverse environment of individuals and organizations where anyone can choose to contribute to the Cardano Ecosystem's growth and success.

Recognizing that the Cardano Blockchain exists within a decentralized ecosystem of blockchain technology, smart contracts, and community governance that is committed to improving economic, political, and social systems globally. The Cardano Blockchain offers a foundational infrastructure which empowers individuals and communities to manage their identity, value, and governance, fostering the emergence of decentralized applications, businesses, and networks.

Acknowledging that the Cardano Ecosystem has expanded significantly and is operated in a decentralized and permissionless manner, further strengthening the resilience and autonomy of the Cardano Blockchain.

Considering that as the Cardano Ecosystem continues to grow, its governance model needs to similarly adapt and evolve to reflect the principles of decentralization, community involvement, accountability, inclusivity, and collaboration as a foundation of self-governance and new approaches to human interaction and collaboration.

Recognizing the need for a more robust and adaptable governance framework that utilizes blockchain technology to establish on-chain governance wherever reasonably possible and beneficial, the Cardano Community hereby establishes this Cardano Constitution including its technical Guardrails that provide a set of safeguards for permissible Governance Actions. The Cardano Constitution sets out the principles for the operation and governance of the Cardano Blockchain as a foundation for anyone to contribute to the development of the Cardano Ecosystem.

Pursuing a culture of trust and collaboration that ensures decisions are made in the best interest of the Cardano Ecosystem in accordance with the principles of transparency, openness, and accountability, the Cardano Community strives to work together towards the continuous improvement, growth, and success of the Cardano Blockchain and Cardano Ecosystem.

Recognizing the importance of providing SPOs and all Ada Holders with an opportunity to contribute to the governance of the Cardano Blockchain to foster a diversity of viewpoints.

Acknowledging the freedom of choice of Ada Holders to contribute to the governance of the Cardano Blockchain independently from any organization or collaborative body.

Recognizing the nature of the Cardano Blockchain as a construct ultimately implemented by software code and hence the critical role of and expectations towards its developers and engineers in upholding and implementing this Constitution.

Recognizing the essential role of the Constitutional Committee in upholding this Constitution and the importance of DReps as representatives of Ada Holders.

Recognizing the necessity of a framework for sustainable, accountable, and effective utilization of the resources available to the Cardano Community in the Cardano Treasury.

Recognizing the right of the Cardano Community to form new collaborative bodies between them to take on the challenges facing the Cardano Ecosystem.

2. The process for participating in, submitting, and voting on Governance Actions shall be transparent and protected from manipulation.

### Section 2: Governance Bodies

Governance of the Cardano Blockchain shall be conducted through three Governance Bodies: DReps, SPOs, and the Constitutional Committee. These Governance Bodies shall provide checks and balances for the Cardano Blockchain.

### Section 3: Governance Actions

1. Ada Holders may at any time propose Governance Action on the Cardano Blockchain. This Constitution currently foresees the following Governance Actions:
   - Motion of No-Confidence, to reject/forfeit/discard the current Constitutional Committee until a replacement is elected/designated;
   - Update Committee and/or threshold and/or term, to change the members or threshold or term of Constitutional Committee members, or any combination thereof;
   - New Constitution or Guardrails Script, to amend the Constitution including the Guardrails or update or remove the guardrails script;
   - Hard-Fork Initiation, to trigger a non-backwards compatible upgrade of the Cardano Blockchain software;
   - Protocol Parameter Change, to trigger one or more changes to updatable parameters of the Cardano Blockchain;
   - Treasury Withdrawal, to withdraw funds from the Cardano Treasury;
   - Info Actions, to allow Cardano Community sentiment to be gauged without committing to any protocol changes.
2. Governance Action proposals shall be in a standardized and legible format and contain sufficient rationale for the proposal, including, as relevant, any suggested changes to the Cardano Blockchain. Where originally written in a language other than the language of this Constitution, Governance Action proposals shall be accompanied by a translation of the Governance Action proposal to the language of this Constitution (English).
3. Treasury withdrawal Governance Actions shall, in particular, include information which specifies whether the contemplated Treasury withdrawal is included within the Cardano Budget or not.
4. Sufficient rationale shall mean that the proposal demonstrates how the proposed Governance Action achieves the intended purpose. Supporting documentation, clear and understandable language and structure, including but not limited to title, an abstract, reason for the proposal, and relevant supporting links, are indicators of sufficient rationale.
5. Governance Action proposals shall include a URL and a hash digest derived from the content pointed to by the URL. An Action shall be deemed constitutional only if the content can be independently verified to produce the same hash digest.
6. Governance Actions for Hard Fork Initiation and Protocol Parameter Change shall undergo sufficient technical review and scrutiny, as set out in the Guardrails. Such Governance Actions shall not endanger the security, functionality, or performance of the Cardano Blockchain.
7. Proposed Governance Actions shall be voted on by the applicable Governance Bodies in order to be ratified and later enacted on-chain as applicable.
8. Info Actions shall be voted on by DReps, SPOs, and the Constitutional Committee. Info Actions have no effect other than to record the outcome of such a vote on the Cardano Blockchain. Info Governance Actions are expressions of Cardano Community sentiment and do not require a “Yes” outcome in order to pass.

### Section 4: Voting

1. Decisions on proposed Governance Actions shall be made by the Constitutional Committee, SPOs, and DReps through the voting process in accordance with the requirements of this Constitution and the Guardrails.
2. DReps and SPOs shall have voting power in proportion to the Lovelace delegated to them. One Lovelace shall equal one vote.
3. Constitutional Committee members shall each have one vote.
4. Votes may be cast as "Yes", "No", or "Abstain".

### Section 5: Voting Thresholds and Quorums

1. Voting thresholds for each Governing Body which are in effect as at the date of first issue of this Constitution have been set in the Conway genesis file and can be changed by a Protocol Parameter Updates Governance Action. Such a Protocol Parameter Update Governance Action shall not constitute an amendment to this Constitution.
2. The voting thresholds shall not fall outside of the following ranges:
   - Constitutional Committee: Votes on all Governance Actions shall pass at a threshold set within the range of 51% - 100%. As at the date of first issue of this Constitution, this threshold is 66.67% of Constitutional Committee members.
   - DReps and SPOs: Voting threshold ranges as specified by the “Guardrails to Voting Thresholds” at 3.6.4 of the Guardrails.
3. The current voting threshold applicable to a Governance Action by a particular Governance Body may be found by consulting the parameters currently implemented on-chain.
4. In addition to a Constitutional Committee vote where required by this Constitution, the following quorums shall apply to the Governance Actions:
   - Parameter changes shall require an affirmative SPO vote and an affirmative DRep vote in order to pass.
   - Hard fork initiations shall require an affirmative SPO vote and an affirmative DRep vote in order to pass.
   - Motion of no confidence and update committee/threshold shall require an affirmative SPO vote and an affirmative DRep vote in order to pass.
   - Treasury withdrawals shall require an affirmative DRep vote in order to pass.
   - Info Governance Actions shall require an SPO vote and a DRep vote, however, no outcome is required as these Governance Actions are used only to gauge and record Cardano Community sentiment.
   - Constitutional amendments shall require an affirmative DRep vote in order to pass.
5. All other Governance Actions shall require an affirmative DRep vote in order to pass.

## Article VI. The Cardano Community
