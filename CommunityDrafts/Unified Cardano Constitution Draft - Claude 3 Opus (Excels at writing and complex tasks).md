Here is a synthesized draft of the Cardano Constitution based on the common values and principles from the community drafts, incorporating the insights from the working notes:

# CARDANO CONSTITUTION 

## PREAMBLE

Recognizing that the Cardano Blockchain has grown into a decentralized ecosystem of technology, smart contracts, and community governance, committed to improving systems globally, we the Cardano Community hereby establish this Constitution.

The Cardano Blockchain empowers individuals and communities to collaboratively manage identity, value, and governance. It is now operated in a decentralized manner, strengthening its resilience and autonomy.  

As Cardano evolves, its governance must adapt to reflect principles of decentralization, accountability, and inclusivity. Through blockchain-based on-chain governance wherever possible, this Constitution provides a framework for all to contribute to Cardano's development.

This Constitution is a living document to be interpreted giving effect to the following core tenets. The Preamble provides context but is non-binding.

## ARTICLE I. CORE TENETS 

### SECTION 1. GUIDING PRINCIPLES

The Cardano Blockchain shall strive to uphold these guiding principles:

1. Maintain a secure, transparent, inclusive and decentralized public blockchain.
2. Promote efficient functionality and resource usage without compromising accessibility or sustainability.  
3. Enable community-driven governance based on legitimacy and broad representation.
4. Ensure financial stability and a predictable long-term economic model.
5. Preserve and incentivize stakeholder contributions to the ecosystem.
6. Uphold user privacy and control over personal data and assets.
7. Foster open innovation, interoperability and collaboration. 
8. Continuously adapt to technological, social and regulatory evolutions.

### SECTION 2. BLOCKCHAIN FUNCTIONALITY

1. Transactions shall be processed efficiently for their intended purpose without undue delay or censorship. 
2. Transaction costs should follow an accessible and predictable model.
3. The Cardano Blockchain shall not unreasonably restrict application development or impede interoperability.
4. Ledger history shall be immutable and assets therein securely preserved.

### SECTION 3. GOVERNANCE VALUES

1. Majority rule shall prevail in governance decisions while respecting minority views and avoiding marginalization of any segment of the community. 
2. All users shall have fair opportunity to participate in governance proportional to their stake.
3. No stakeholder group (SPOs, DReps, CC members, Ada holders) shall unilaterally impose decisions without required approvals.
4. Governance shall remain decentralized and avoid undue accumulation of power.

## ARTICLE II. COMMUNITY AND MEMBERSHIP 

1. All Ada holders, developers, SPOs and other supporters of the Cardano Blockchain shall be considered part of the Cardano Community and beneficiaries of this Constitution. Formal membership is not required for participation.
2. Ada holders are entitled to participate in on-chain governance, including proposing and voting on actions, in accordance with this Constitution and the Cardano Blockchain's technical Guardrails.

## ARTICLE III. GOVERNANCE MODEL

1. On-chain governance shall serve as the primary decision-making model utilizing smart contracts and blockchain-based tools.
2. Governance bodies - the Constitutional Committee (CC), Delegated Representatives (DReps), and Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) - shall provide decentralized checks and balances, with specified quorums and thresholds.
3. DReps shall represent Ada holders' stake and vote on their behalf. SPOs shall approve technical changes like hard forks and parameter updates. CC shall ensure actions comply with this Constitution.
4. Details on governance processes, voting, and quorums shall be as specified in the Blockchain Guardrails document, subject to change via on-chain updates.
5. An annual on-chain budget shall govern the usage of the Cardano Treasury, with funds disbursed transparently for ecosystem development and sustainability as approved by the Community.

## ARTICLE IV. AMENDMENTS AND INTERPRETATION

1. Amendments to this Constitution shall require approval via on-chain action by DReps with a minimum 67% threshold of active stake.
2. CC shall be the arbiter for interpretation of this Constitution and conformity of actions to it. 
3. In case of conflict between this Constitution and the technical Guardrails implemented on-chain, the on-chain rules shall prevail while CC works to resolve the inconsistency.
4. This Constitution shall be reviewed periodically to adapt to evolutions in technology, governance needs, and regulations.
