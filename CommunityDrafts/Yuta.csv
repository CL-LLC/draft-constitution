Creation policy of v1.1 [Simple version] ,,,,
"The important thing is to respect the Constitution of the Constitutional Convention, not to make any essential changes to it, and to focus only on simplifying it. The aim is not to deny the Constitution of the Constitutional Convention, but to strengthen it by simplifying it.",,,,
1. Carefully correct duplicated and redundant expressions to make them simple. Carefully confirm that there are no changes to the intended content or effect from the version approved by the Constitutional Convention.,,,,
"2. We remove language that we believe will have no practical effect if removed, and we are careful to make sure that no one is harmed by this removal.",,,,
3. No new ideas added. v1.1 will focus on simplification.,,,,
4. We will be ignoring Guardrails and TENET in order to focus on submitting v1.1 for GA in January or February.,,,,
