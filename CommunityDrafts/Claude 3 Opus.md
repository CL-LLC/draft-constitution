Here is a synthesized draft of the Cardano Constitution based on the common values and principles from the community drafts, incorporating the insights from the working notes:

# CARDANO CONSTITUTION 

## PREAMBLE

Recognizing that the Cardano Blockchain has grown into a decentralized ecosystem of technology, smart contracts, and community governance, committed to improving systems globally, we the Cardano Community hereby establish this Constitution.

The Cardano Blockchain empowers individuals and communities to collaboratively manage identity, value, and governance. It is now operated in a decentralized manner, strengthening its resilience and autonomy.  

As Cardano evolves, its governance must adapt to reflect principles of decentralization, accountability, and inclusivity. Through blockchain-based on-chain governance wherever possible, this Constitution provides a framework for all to contribute to Cardano's development.

This Constitution is a living document to be interpreted giving effect to the following core tenets. The Preamble provides context but is non-binding.

## ARTICLE I. CORE TENETS 

### SECTION 1. GUIDING PRINCIPLES

The Cardano Blockchain shall strive to uphold these guiding principles:

1. Maintain a secure, transparent, inclusive and decentralized public blockchain.
2. Promote efficient functionality and resource usage without compromising accessibility or sustainability.  
3. Enable community-driven governance based on legitimacy and broad representation.
4. Ensure financial stability and a predictable long-term economic model.
5. Preserve and incentivize stakeholder contributions to the ecosystem.
6. Uphold user privacy and control over personal data and assets.
7. Foster open innovation, interoperability and collaboration. 
8. Continuously adapt to technological, social and regulatory evolutions.

### SECTION 2. BLOCKCHAIN FUNCTIONALITY

1. Transactions shall be processed efficiently for their intended purpose without undue delay or censorship. 
2. Transaction costs should follow an accessible and predictable model.
3. The Cardano Blockchain shall not unreasonably restrict application development or impede interoperability.
4. Ledger history shall be immutable and assets therein securely preserved.

### SECTION 3. GOVERNANCE VALUES

1. Majority rule shall prevail in governance decisions while respecting minority views and avoiding marginalization of any segment of the community. 
2. All users shall have fair opportunity to participate in governance proportional to their stake.
3. No stakeholder group (SPOs, DReps, CC members, Ada holders) shall unilaterally impose decisions without required approvals.
4. Governance shall remain decentralized and avoid undue accumulation of power.

## ARTICLE II. COMMUNITY AND MEMBERSHIP 

1. All Ada holders, developers, SPOs and other supporters of the Cardano Blockchain shall be considered part of the Cardano Community and beneficiaries of this Constitution. Formal membership is not required for participation.
2. Ada holders are entitled to participate in on-chain governance, including proposing and voting on actions, in accordance with this Constitution and the Cardano Blockchain's technical Guardrails.

## ARTICLE III. GOVERNANCE MODEL

1. On-chain governance shall serve as the primary decision-making model utilizing smart contracts and blockchain-based tools.
2. Governance bodies - the Constitutional Committee (CC), Delegated Representatives (DReps), and Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) - shall provide decentralized checks and balances, with specified quorums and thresholds.
3. DReps shall represent Ada holders' stake and vote on their behalf. SPOs shall approve technical changes like hard forks and parameter updates. CC shall ensure actions comply with this Constitution.
4. Details on governance processes, voting, and quorums shall be as specified in the Blockchain Guardrails document, subject to change via on-chain updates.
5. An annual on-chain budget shall govern the usage of the Cardano Treasury, with funds disbursed transparently for ecosystem development and sustainability as approved by the Community.

## ARTICLE IV. BLOCKCHAIN PARAMETERS AND GUARDRAILS

1. The technical parameters and limitations of the Cardano Blockchain, including those related to economic, network, governance, and security aspects, shall be detailed in the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails document.
2. The Guardrails shall aim to ensure the blockchain operates securely and sustainably, avoiding disruptions or vulnerabilities. They apply to on-chain governance actions like parameter changes and Treasury usage.
3. Where possible, Guardrails shall be automated and enforced through on-chain scripts or ledger rules. Amendments to the Guardrails shall follow the process for Constitutional amendments.
4. Inconsistencies between the implemented on-chain parameters and the Guardrails document shall be resolved by deeming the on-chain implementation authoritative while the CC works to rectify the documentation.

## ARTICLE V. GOVERNANCE BODIES AND PROCEDURES

### SECTION 1. DELEGATED REPRESENTATIVES (DReps)

1. Any Ada holder may register as a DRep to represent the stake delegated to them in governance votes. Registration procedures and fees shall be as specified in the Guardrails.
2. DReps shall vote on behalf of their delegators in accordance with delegator instructions where provided, or otherwise at their discretion in line with their published policies and the best interests of the Cardano ecosystem.
3. DReps shall maintain public transparency about their voting policies, rationales, and potential conflicts of interest. They may be compensated for their efforts as approved by the Community.

### SECTION 2. STAKE POOL OPERATORS (SPOs) 

1. SPOs shall participate in governance decisions related to the operation and integrity of the Cardano Blockchain, with voting power proportional to their stake.
2. SPOs must abide by the technical requirements and performance standards defined in the Guardrails to ensure network security and liveness.
3. SPOs shall disclose if they are also voting as DReps or CC members on any given proposal to avoid conflicts of interest.

### SECTION 3. CONSTITUTIONAL COMMITTEE (CC)

1. The CC shall be composed of 3-9 members serving staggered terms as defined in the Guardrails, elected by Ada holders via on-chain voting.
2. The CC shall review all governance proposals for compliance with this Constitution before such proposals proceed to a vote by DReps or SPOs. 
3. The CC may veto proposals deemed unconstitutional but shall otherwise remain neutral. CC deliberations and decisions shall be made public.
4. A proposal to remove and replace all or some CC members may be brought via a DRep-initiated on-chain action subject to required thresholds.

### SECTION 4. GOVERNANCE ACTIONS AND VOTING

1. Any community member may submit a governance proposal in the required format, subject to any deposit requirements in the Guardrails. 
2. Proposals shall be classified into standardized types like Treasury Withdrawals, Parameter Changes, Constitutional Amendments, etc. as defined in the Guardrails, each with specified procedures and thresholds.
3. Voting on proposals shall be recorded on-chain, with outcomes determined by the applicable DRep, SPO, or Ada holder majority thresholds reached.
4. For expedited action in emergencies, the CC may provisionally approve temporary measures which must then be ratified or rejected via a standard governance vote within a defined timeframe.

## ARTICLE VI. TREASURY AND FUNDS MANAGEMENT

1. The Cardano Treasury shall be governed by an annual on-chain budget proposed by the community and approved by Ada holders.
2. Treasury withdrawals shall only be permitted in accordance with the approved Budget and subject to any transparency and reporting requirements in the Guardrails.
