# CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN ECOSYSTEM CONSTITUTION

## PREAMBLE

Through adopting this Constitution, the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem shall establish a robust
governance framework, ensuring that decisions are made in the best interest of the Cardano
community. The Cardano community shall uphold principles of transparency, openness, and
responsible governance, promoting a culture of trust and collaboration.

All owners of ada shall have the opportunity to contribute to the governance and direction of the
decentralized Cardano Blockchain ecosystem.

By necessity, this Constitution recognizes the role of and empowers the Constitutional
Committee, confirms the right of the Cardano community to participate in collective bodies for
collaboration, gives effect to on-chain governance, and empowers DReps to act as the voice of
ada owners for on-chain voting.

The Constitution also recognizes the necessity of safeguarding access to and the use of funds of
the Cardano treasury through the inclusion of the Cardano Guardrails in this Constitution.

## ARTICLE I. CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN TENETS AND GUARDRAILS

### Section 1

These below Tenets shall guide the Constitutional Committee and proposed governance actions shall be evaluated in accordance
with these Tenets.

Transactions on the Cardano Blockchain should not be slowed down or censored and should be
expediently served for their intended purpose.

The cost of transactions on the Cardano Blockchain should be predictable and not unreasonable.

Anyone desiring to develop and deploy applications on the Cardano Blockchain should not
unreasonably be prevented from developing and deploying such applications as intended.

The Cardano Blockchain shall not lock in an ada owner’s value without an owner’s consent.

The Cardano Blockchain shall preserve in a safe manner any value and information an owner of
ada seeks to store on the Cardano Blockchain. 

The Cardano Blockchain shall not unnecessarily spend resources. The Cardano Blockchain shall
promote efficient design, memory and storage.

### Section 2

The Cardano Blockchain shall operate in accordance with the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails as
set forth in the Guardrails Appendix to this Constitution. The Cardano community may from
time to time digitally codify certain Cardano Blockchain Guardrails such that such Cardano
Blockchain Guardrails are directly programmed and implemented on the Cardano Blockchain
using on-chain scripts or built-in ledger rules.

In the event there are inconsistencies between a Cardano Blockchain Guardrail as set forth in the
Guardrails Appendix and any such Cardano Blockchain Guardrail that has been programmed and
implemented on the Cardano Blockchain, the version of such Cardano Blockchain Guardrail that
has been deployed directly on the Cardano Blockchain shall prevail and the Constitutional
Committee shall seek to reconcile such inconsistencies through the encouragement of an
appropriate on-chain governance action.

## ARTICLE II. THE CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN COMMUNITY

### Section 1

No formal membership shall be required to use, participate in and benefit from the Cardano
Blockchain.

### Section 2

Members of the Cardano community who own ada _[, as well as their appointed designees,]_ are
entitled to access and participate in the on-chain decision-making processes of the Cardano
Blockchain ecosystem, including voting and taking part in on-chain governance regarding the
Cardano Blockchain.

## ARTICLE III. PARTICIPATORY GOVERNANCE

### Section 1

The Cardano Blockchain ecosystem shall be governed by a decentralized, on-chain governance
model.

### Section 3

On-chain governance decisions shall be made through a collective decision-making process, with
specific consensus threshold requirements as required by the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails.
All on-chain governance actions shall be voted upon in accordance with the Cardano Blockchain
Guardrails.

All owners of ada _[, as well as their appointed designees,]_ shall have the right to propose changes
to the governance structure of the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem in accordance with the
Cardano Blockchain Guardrails.

### Section 6

All owners of ada shall have the right to ensure that the process for participating in, submitting
and voting on on-chain governance actions is open and transparent and is protected from undue
influence and manipulation.

### Section 8

The Cardano community is expected to propose, not less than on an annual basis, a budget for
the ongoing maintenance and future development of the Cardano Blockchain. All owners of
ada _[, as well as their appointed designees,]_ are expected to periodically approve the Cardano
Blockchain budget through an on-chain governance action. No withdrawals from the Cardano
treasury shall be permitted unless a budget for the Cardano Blockchain is then in effect as
required by the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails.

_[Any governance action requesting ada from the Cardano Blockchain treasury in excess of
[1,000,000] ada shall require an allocation of ada as a part of such funding request to cover the
cost of periodic independent audits and the implementation of oversight metrics as to the use of
such ada.] [Contractual obligations governing the use of ada received from the Cardano
Blockchain treasury pursuant to a Cardano budget in excess of [1,000,000] shall include dispute
resolution provisions.]_

## ARTICLE IV. DELEGATED REPRESENTATIVES

### Section 2

Any owner of ada shall have the option to register as a DRep. Any owner of ada _[, as well as
their appointed designees,]_ shall be allowed to delegate their voting stake to one or more
registered DReps, including themselves.

## ARTICLE V. STAKE POOL OPERATORS

### Section 1

SPOs shall have a specific role in approving critical on-chain governance actions which require
additional oversight and independence, voting separately and independently from DReps as set
forth in the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails.

## ARTICLE VI. CONSTITUTIONAL COMMITTEE

### Section 1

A Constitutional Committee shall be established as the branch of Cardano's on-chain governance
process that ensures governance actions are consistent with this Constitution. The Constitutional
Committee shall comprise a set of owners of ada _[, including their appointed designees,]_ that is
collectively responsible for ensuring that on-chain governance actions prior to enactment on-
chain, are constitutional. The Constitutional Committee shall be limited to voting on the
constitutionality of governance actions.

### Section 2

The Constitutional Committee shall be composed of _[such number of members as shall be
determined from time to time by owners of ada]_ , as consistent with the Cardano Blockchain
Guardrails.

### Section 2

Members of the Constitutional Committee shall serve such terms _[as shall be determined from
time to time by owners of ada]_ as consistent with the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails.


### Section 4

No governance action, other than a "Motion of no-confidence" or "Update constitutional
committee/threshold" may be implemented on-chain unless the Constitutional Committee shall
have first determined and affirmed through an on-chain action that such proposal does not violate
this Constitution.

### Section 5

Constitutional Committee processes shall be transparent. The Constitutional Committee shall
publish each decision. When voting _[no]_ on a proposal, _[the Constitutional Committee] [each
member of the Constitutional committee casting a no vote]_ shall set forth the basis for its
decision with reference to specific Articles of this Constitution that are in conflict with a given
proposal.

## ARTICLE VII. AMENDMENTS

### Section 1

Except as otherwise so provided in the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix, amendments
to this Constitution, including to the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix, shall be
approved by a collective decision-making process, requiring an on-chain governance action by
owners of ada _[, including their appointed designees,]_ satisfying a threshold of not less than 67%
of the then active voting stake.

### Section 2

If the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix sets forth an amendment threshold for a
Cardano Blockchain Guardrail that is different than the amendment threshold contained in
Section 1 of this Article VII, then the threshold set forth in the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails
Appendix for such Cardano Blockchain Guardrail shall apply.
