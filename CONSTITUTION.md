# CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN ECOSYSTEM CONSTITUTION

## PREAMBLE

Through the adoption of this Constitution, the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem establishes a transparent and accountable governance framework to ensure that decisions are made in the best interest of the Cardano community. The Constitution acknowledges the role and empowers the Constitutional Committee to enforce its articles and make decisions when "code as law" is insufficient, necessitating the presence of a governance structure with people in the loop. This Constitution serves as a guiding document to promote the long-term sustainability and success of the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem.

## ARTICLE I. CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN TENETS AND GUARDRAILS

### Section 1

Transactions on the Cardano Blockchain shall not be intentionally degraded or censored.

The cost of transactions on the Cardano Blockchain should be predictable and reasonable.

When contributions to the system are recognized, recorded, or processed, they should be done so fairly.

The system shall not spend, delegate, or stake any ADA owner’s assets without the owner’s consent.

The Cardano Blockchain shall reasonably preserve any value and information an owner of ADA seeks to store, while accommodating evolving innovations that ensure sustainable resource management.

Resources, whether system, network, or economic, shall not be unnecessarily wasted.

Users shall be treated fairly, and the system shall adapt in alignment with their collective will, ensuring long-term sustainability and viability.

The system shall not require users to violate local laws and regulations, and should provide alternatives whenever feasible.

Operations should be transparent, predictable, verifiable, and interpretable, ensuring fairness and balance, while also supporting privacy-focused use cases where appropriate.

### Section 2

### Section 4

No withdrawals from the Cardano treasury shall be permitted except as part of a periodic budget as-required by the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails.

No withdrawals from the Cardano treasury in excess of 1,000,000 ADA shall be permitted without sufficient independent audits, oversight metrics, and a reasonable amount of ADA to cover the cost of such audits.

The total supply of ADA shall not be modified to be less or more than 45,000,000,000.

## ARTICLE IV. DELEGATED REPRESENTATIVES

### Section 1

Any owner of ADA shall have the permissionless option to register as a dRep. 

Any owner of ADA shall be allowed to delegate their voting stake to one or more registered dReps, including themselves.

Any owner of ADA shall have the permissionless option to register a stake pool.

Any owner of ADA shall be allowed to delegate their voting stake to one or more registered stake pools, including their own.

## ARTICLE VI. CONSTITUTIONAL COMMITTEE

### Section 1

The Constitutional Committee shall be limited to voting on the constitutionality of governance actions.

### Section 2

The Constitutional Committee shall be composed of a set number of members and must pass any proposals via a voting threshold defined by the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails.

### Section 3

Members of the Constitutional Committee shall serve terms for a specific period of time as-defined by the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails.

### Section 4

The Constitutional Committee shall transparently publish each decision and provide the basis for any "no" votes with reference to specific Articles of this Constitution.

## ARTICLE VII. AMENDMENTS

### Section 1

Amendments to this Constitution require approval through an on-chain governance action by ADA owners, meeting a threshold set by the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails and corresponding parameters for constitutional amendments.

### Section 2

In case of inconsistencies between the Guardrails documented in the Appendix and the Guardrails implemented on-chain, the on-chain version shall prevail, and the Constitutional Committee shall work to reconcile such inconsistencies through appropriate governance actions.

## APPENDIX I: CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN GUARDRAILS

### 1. Introduction

This Appendix sets forth guardrails that must be applied to Cardano on-chain governance actions. These guardrails cover both essential, intrinsic limits on settings, and recommendations that are based on experience, measurement and governance objectives.

These guardrails are designed to avoid unexpected problems with the operation of the Cardano Blockchain. They are intended to guide the choice of sensible parameter settings and avoid potential problems with security, performance or functionality. As described below, some of these guardrails are automatable and will be enforced via an on-chain script or built-in ledger rules.  However, many of them require the input of human experts which will be enforced by the Constitutional Committee through referencing this document.

#### Automated Checking ("Guardrails Script")

A script hash is associated with the constitution hash when a New Constitution or Guardrails Script governance action is enacted. It acts as an additional safeguard to the ledger rules and types, filtering non-compliant governance actions.

The guardrails script only affects two types of governance actions:

- Parameter Update actions.
- Treasury Withdrawal actions.

The script is executed when either of these types of governance action is submitted on-chain. The purpose of this script is to avoid scenarios where an erroneous script could prevent the chain from ever enacting a Hard Fork action, resulting in deadlock.

##### Symbol and Explanation

- (y) The script can be used to enforce the guardrail.
- (x) The script cannot be used to enforce the guardrail.
- (~ - reason) The script cannot be used to enforce the guardrail for the reason given, but future ledger changes could enable this.

Guardrails may overlap: in this case, the most restrictive set of guardrails will apply.

### 2. GUARDRAILS AND GUIDELINES ON PROTOCOL PARAMETER UPDATE ACTIONS

- PARAM-01 (y) Any protocol parameter that is not explicitly named in this document must not be changed by a Parameter update governance action.
- PARAM-02 (y) Where a protocol parameter is explicitly listed in this document but no checkable guardrails are specified, the guardrails script must not impose any constraints on changes to the parameter. Checkable guardrails are shown by a (y).

#### 2.1 Critical Protocol Parameters

##### Parameters that are Critical to the Operation of the Blockchain

- `maxBlockBodySize` (maximum block body size)
- `maxTxSize` (maximum transaction size)
- `maxBlockHeaderSize` (maximum block header size)
- `maxValueSize` (maximum size of a serialized asset value)
- `maxBlockExecutionUnits` (maximum script execution/memory units in a single block)
- `txFeePerByte` (minimum fee coefficient)
- `txFeeFixed` (minimum fee constant)
- `minFeeRefScriptCoinsPerByte` (minimum fee per byte for reference scripts)
- `utxoCostPerByte` (minimum Lovelace deposit per byte of serialized UTxO)
- `govDeposit` (governance action deposit)

Guardrails:
- PARAM-03 (y) Critical protocol parameters require an SPO vote in addition to a DRep vote: SPOs must say "yes" with a collective support of more than 50% of all active block production stake. This is enforced by the guardrails on the stake pool voting threshold.
- PARAM-04 (x) At least 3 months should pass between the publication of an off-chain proposal to change a critical protocol parameter and the submission of the corresponding on-chain governance action. This guardrail may be relaxed in the event of an emergency network issue following careful technical discussion and evaluation.

#### 2.7 Guardrails and Guidelines on Hard Fork Initiation Actions

Guardrails:
- HARDFORK-01 (~ - no access to existing parameter values) The major protocol version must be the same as or one greater than the major version that will be enacted immediately prior to this change. If the major protocol version is one greater, then the minor protocol version must be zero.
- HARDFORK-02 (~ - no access to existing parameter values) The minor protocol version must be no less than the minor version that will be enacted immediately prior to this change.
- HARDFORK-03 (~ - no access to existing parameter values) At least one of the protocol versions (major or minor or both) must change.
- HARDFORK-04 (x) At least 85% of stake pools by active stake should have upgraded to a Cardano node version that is capable of processing the rules associated with the new protocol version.
- HARDFORK-05 (x) Any new updatable protocol parameters that are introduced with a hard fork must be included in this Appendix and suitable guardrails defined for those parameters.
- HARDFORK-06 (x) Settings for any new protocol parameters that are introduced with a hard fork must be included in the appropriate Genesis file.
- HARDFORK-07 (x) Any deprecated protocol parameters must be indicated in this Appendix.
- HARDFORK-08 (~ - no access to Plutus cost model parameters) New Plutus versions must be supported by a version-specific Plutus cost model that covers each primitive that is available in the new Plutus version.

#### 2.8 Guardrails and Guidelines on Update Constitutional Committee or Threshold Actions

Guardrails:
- UPDATE-CC-01 (x) Update Constitutional Committee and/or threshold and/or term governance actions must not be ratified until ADA holders have ratified through an on-chain governance action the Final Constitution.

---

#### 2.9 Guardrails and Guidelines on New Constitution or Guardrails Script Actions

Guardrails:
- NEW-CONSTITUTION-01 (x) A New Constitution or Guardrails Script governance action must be submitted to define any required guardrails for new parameters that are introduced via a Hard Fork governance action.

#### 2.10. Monitoring and Reversion of Parameter Changes

A specific reversion/recovery plan must be produced for each parameter change. This plan must include:

- Which parameters need to change and in which ways in order to return to the previous state (or a similar state).
- How to recover the network in the event of a disastrous failure.

This plan should be followed if problems are observed following the parameter change. Note that not all changes can be reverted. Additional care must be taken when making changes to these parameters.

---

#### 2.11. Non-Updatable Protocol Parameters

Some fundamental protocol parameters cannot be changed by the Protocol Parameter Update governance action. These parameters can only be changed in a new Genesis file as part of a hard fork. It is not necessary to provide specific guardrails on updating these parameters.

### LIST OF PROTOCOL PARAMETER GROUPS

The protocol parameters are grouped by type, allowing different thresholds to be set for each group.

The network group consists of:
- `maxBlockBodySize` (maximum block body size)
- `maxTxSize` (maximum transaction size)
- `maxBlockHeaderSize` (maximum block header size)
- `maxValueSize` (maximum size of a serialized asset value)
- `maxTxExecutionUnits[steps]` (maximum script execution units in a single transaction)
- `maxBlockExecutionUnits[steps]` (maximum script execution units in a single block)
- `maxCollateralInputs` (maximum number of collateral inputs)

The economic group consists of:
- `txFeePerByte` (minimum fee coefficient)
- `txFeeFixed` (minimum fee constant)
- `minFeeRefScriptCoinsPerByte` (minimum fee per byte for reference scripts)
- `stakeAddressDeposit` (delegation key Lovelace deposit)
- `stakePoolDeposit` (pool registration Lovelace deposit)
- `monetaryExpansion` (monetary expansion)
- `treasuryCut` (treasury expansion)
- `minPoolCost` (minimum fixed rewards cut for pools)
- `utxoCostPerByte` (minimum Lovelace deposit per byte of serialized UTxO)
- `executionUnitPrices[priceSteps/priceMemory]` (prices of Plutus execution units)

The technical group consists of:
- `poolPledgeInfluence` (pool pledge influence)
- `poolRetireMaxEpoch` (pool retirement maximum epoch)
- `stakePoolTargetNum` (desired number of pools)
- `costModels` (Plutus execution cost models)
- `collateralPercentage` (proportion of collateral needed for scripts)

The governance group consists of all the new protocol parameters that are introduced in CIP-1694:
- `dRepVotingThresholds[...]`, `poolVotingThresholds[...]` (governance voting thresholds)
- `govActionLifetime` (governance action maximum lifetime in epochs)
- `govActionDeposit` (governance action deposit)
- `dRepDeposit` (DRep deposit amount)
- `dRepActivity` (DRep activity period in epochs)
- `committeeMinSize` (minimal constitutional committee size)
- `committeeMaxTermLimit` (maximum term length in epochs for the constitutional committee members)
