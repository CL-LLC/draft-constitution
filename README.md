# Cardano Constitution: Community Edition

The goal of this fork of the Draft Cardano Constitution is to encourage and
promote community contribution and feedback into the Constitution drafting
process.

This forked version of the Draft Cardano Constitution was published by Intersect
on July 29th, 2024 in alignment with the beginning of a large series of
in-person workshops held around the world for the purpose of garnering feedback
and discussion on various topics.

However, given:

1. The workshops, being only single-day affairs, were necessarily scoped and
   moderated rather heavily in order to generate constructive outputs.
2. Even with 60+ workshops in 50+ countries, it's unlikely that every community
   member who is interested in participating was able to attend an in-person
   workshop

We feel that it is imperative to conduct a "virtual first" and asynchronous
Constitutional Convention process in order to highlight and emphasize
contributions from the rest of the community who may or may not have attended
the in-person workshops.

## How to Participate

Please see the [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions in how to
get involved!

## License

Given that the Cardano Constitution should be a long-lived and ever evolving
document to help guide and govern the Community in the era of decentralized
governance, no individual author attribution nor copyright should ever be placed
within the body of the document. It is expected that all contributions of
language to the document are being submitted into the Public Domain (PD) under
